Druptask depends on Drush
it use drush <= 4.5 and no higher version because of some bug in drush version 5 when creating drupal users

If drush is not installed, you can do that via pear :
pear channel-discover drush-ops.github.com/pear
pear install drush-ops/drush


If a higher version of 4.5 is already installed via pear you can remove it by this way :
pear uninstall pear.drush.org/drush
pear channel-delete pear.drush.org
